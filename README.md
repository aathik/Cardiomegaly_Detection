### Cardiomegaly Detection from Chest X-Rays using CNN, Transfer Learning with Attention Algorithm



Cardiomegaly is a condition where the heart is enlarged beyond its normal size due to various factors. The patient's ability to receive effective treatment depends on the early identification of cardiomegaly. For the categorization of cardiomegaly in chest X-ray images, we proposed a comparative analysis of four different deep-learning models in this paper. For the objective of cardiomegaly detection from chest X-rays, we evaluated the results of ResNet50, InceptionV3, DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB0 on balanced and unbalanced datasets. In the validation set, MobileNetV1 obtained the maximum accuracy of 0.7968, while in the test set, it achieved the best accuracy of 0.781. In the unbalanced dataset, MobileNetV1 achieved the highest accuracy of 0.8458 in the validation set and 0.8386 in the test set. The outcomes also demonstrate that the performance of the models varied considerably according to how the rest of the dataset was distributed.
